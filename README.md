1. Platform Dominance

Console platforms (PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox) dominate global sales.

Older platforms (e.g., PS2, DS) often outperform newer ones because they had longer lifecycles.

Platform success is strongly tied to exclusive titles.

2. Regional Sales Patterns

North America is usually the largest market, driving global sales trends.

Japan shows a distinct preference for certain platforms (Nintendo, handhelds) and genres.

Europe closely follows North America but with slightly different genre preferences.

Other regions contribute significantly less but still affect global totals.

3. Top Genres

Action and Sports games consistently generate the highest sales.

Role-Playing Games (RPGs) perform exceptionally well in Japan.

Shooter games are especially strong in North America and Europe.

Niche genres sell fewer units but can have highly loyal audiences.

4. Publishers Matter

A small number of publishers (e.g., Nintendo, EA, Activision) account for a large share of total sales.

Nintendo stands out for high sales per title due to strong IPs (Mario, Pokémon, Zelda).

Third-party publishers rely more on multi-platform releases.

5. Sales Over Time

Game sales peaked during the late 2000s–early 2010s, aligning with console boom years.

Declines in later years often reflect:

Shift to digital sales (not captured in older datasets)

Market saturation

Rise of mobile gaming

6. Global vs Regional Hits

Some games succeed globally, while others are region-specific hits.

Designing for regional taste can significantly improve performance (especially in Japan).
